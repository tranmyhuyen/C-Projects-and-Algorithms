## Expression Evaluation with Variables

Write a program that reads and evaluates a mathematical expression containing:

Single-digit numbers (0 - 9)
Single-character variables (e.g., x)
Operators +, -, and *
Parentheses for grouping
Input

The first line contain a string s (without spaces) representing the expression to be evaluated.
Each following line contains a command, which is one of followings:
SET v x
sets or updates the value of the variable x to v.
PRINT
evaluates the expression s and prints the result on a new line. If a variable is undefined, assume its value is 0. 
DONE
terminates the process.
Output

For each command PRINT, output the result of the evaluated expression on a new line. See the "For Examples" section for more details.
Hints

Use the Shunting-yard algorithm to convert the infix expression to a postfix expression.
Use a stack to build an expression tree from the postfix expression.
Use a map (e.g., a hash table) to store and update variable values.
Use a tree traversal algorithm to evaluate the expression tree..
